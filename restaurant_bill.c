/*get user input from command line with "int main(int argc, char *argv[])"
validate input by making sure argc == 2 AND that argv[0] and argv[1] are both floats
save argv[0] as float variable "tax" and argv[1] as float variable "tip"
generate random number between 0-4 to choose meal price
if(randnum = 0) mealprice = 9.95 etc
calculate tip by multiplying "tip" by meal price
calculate tax by multiplying "tax" by meal price
sum tax + tip + mealprice = total bill
